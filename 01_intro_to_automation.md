# Introduction to Automation Testing

## What is Automation Testing?

Automation testing is the process of executing test cases using specialized tools and scripts instead of manual intervention.
The goal is to increase **accuracy**, **speed**, and **repeatability** of testing.

## Why Automation?

* Manual testing is slow and error-prone.
* Automated tests can be executed anytime — even overnight.
* Supports continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

## When to Automate

* Repetitive regression tests.
* Cross-browser validation.
* Data-driven tests.
* High-volume or performance-based testing.

## Common Tools

* **Selenium WebDriver** – Web-based automation.
* **PyTest / JUnit / TestNG** – Testing frameworks.
* **Playwright / Cypress** – Modern automation alternatives.
* **Postman / RestAssured** – API testing.
* **Jenkins / GitHub Actions** – Continuous testing pipelines.

**Example:**

> Automating a login page to check valid and invalid credentials on each code deployment.
